## ❓ What is SafeSpace?

**SafeSpace** is an AI-powered safety monitoring application that provides users with real-time alerts about potential threats in their vicinity. It combines geolocation, live news feeds, and social media intelligence using natural language processing to detect incidents like violence, protests, riots, disasters, or other threats – helping users make safer decisions, faster.

---

## 🚨 Problem It Solves

- People often walk into dangerous zones unknowingly due to lack of real-time information.
- Existing safety apps rely on user-reported events, which leads to delayed alerts.
- Lack of integration between location, AI, and internet-based threat signals.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Fetch Real-Time Data** from news APIs, social feeds (optional), and internal reports.
2. **Process Text with NLP Models** to detect risky events or threatening keywords.
3. **Compare with User’s Location** using browser-based geolocation API.
4. **Send Smart Alerts** with confidence scores and suggested actions.
